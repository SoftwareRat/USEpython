# Unauthorized Software Enabler
*This  project  aims  to  simplify  the  use  of  custom code  on  [GeForce  NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/geforce-now).*

Please note that this software does not give you administrator privileges

# FAQ
## How to use it?
The software can only be made to run by arbitrary code execution, which the user has to bring along himself. It does not come with its own methods, but is rather a workaround for something like this. You can download the binary file and run it on GeForce NOW.

## Why are you making this open source?
I have wasted countless days on this project, and don't want to become dependent on whether people want to provide methods for free or not. Instead of letting the project fizzle out, I'm making the source code public so that it still has a meaningful use.

## Is this legal?
⚠️ **TL;DR: It violates the terms and conditions of GeForce NOW and therefore the use of it is at your own risk!**

**Long version:** I can't say much in terms of criminal law, as every country has a different version and I advise you to check the legal situation before running this program. Overall, I can say that this is more of a gray area, as it takes place on NVIDIA's servers, but you are provided with a complete VM with hardware that is used exclusively by you. Whether Fortnite or Mozilla Firefox is running on it makes no technical difference. You shouldn't compare this to "evil hacking", as NVIDIA provides you with access to your own VM, but rather to legal jailbreaking, as we know it from iPhones or video game consoles. 

However it violates NVIDIA's Terms of Use:

> 3.4 **You may not misuse, disrupt or exploit GFN or NVIDIA servers for any unauthorized use, or try to access areas or download software** or
> materials not intended for users (including using GFN in any way to
> access any unauthorized third-party sites), or load to NVIDIA servers
> any malware (such as viruses, drop dead device, worm, trojan horse,
> trap, back door or other software routine of such nature), or disturb
> the use and enjoyment of GFN by other users.`

Even  if  harmless  legitimate  software  is  downloaded,  NVIDIA  considers  this  to  be  a  violation.
